<h1>climate and enviroment</h1>
<p>How aware are you when it comes to what you throw away every day, what you eat and what you do. Climate change is a big subject. It isn't just up to the goverment. You are the one that makes the biggest change.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands we produce nearly 490 kilos of waste per person per year. We deliver more than half of this separately. Paper and glass are at the forefront: we bring more than 70 percent of them to the paper bin or glass bin. 60 percent of the organic waste is separated, plastic packaging and drinking suits are on the rise.</p>
<p>The goverment can shut down the big projects. Like gas extraction some countries or oil extraction in other countries. But this costs them a lot of money, so they have to do that in small steps. That takes time, what you can do in the mean time: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>separate your waste.</li>
  <li>If you are going to travel take the train or go by bike and try to avoid airplanes or cars/buses.</li>
    <li>If you want/need new clothes go to a vintage store or look in your fathers/mothers wardrobe. it is unique and you can make it your own.</li>
